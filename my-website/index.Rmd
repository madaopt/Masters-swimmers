I explored the New England LMSC Short Course Yards Championship individual event outcomes from 2009 to 2019. Below is a 2 minutes video that walks you through the website's highlights.

**Important**: I built this website in 2019 as a class project. However, I spent so much time on it that it became more than a school project. I revisited my code FOUR years later and decided to share it publicly. The video was made in 2019.

Where you can explore: 1. Your connections; 2. Your individual records (and plots!); 3. How fast swimmers did over time vs. How others did over time; and more!

- [Inference](https://madaopt.github.io/Masters-swimmers/inf.html)  
Where I did one cross-sectional analysis and one longitudinal analysis on meet participation and the swimming pace over time. Check it out!
