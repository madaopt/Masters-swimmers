## Welcome to My Page

### This project used to be my data science course final project (I took in 2019). I procrastinated until now (2023!) to revisit the page and polish it. 

This project used to be my data science course final project (I took in 2019). However, I procrastinated until now (2023!) to revisit the page and polish it.

### If you are looking for:


*If you are looking for **DATA CLEANING***, please head to the **“raw data”** folder, where you can find:

  -All the raw data I used for this project (in.csv format). Any .CL2 file (the "very raw" data) has been converted to a text/.csv file. 

  -**“Data cleaning final doc.Rmd”** is the code for data cleaning. The output is a longitudinal file that collapsed 11 years of individual meet results (2009-2019).

  -**“Data cleaning for inference final.Rmd”** is the additional cleaning code for visualization and inference. 

***Warning:*** It may take a while to run the first code. You can find the output data in the “visual” folder and the “my-website” folder. You need some output from the first code to run the second code. It will be easier for you just to use the data from other folders.

*If you are looking for **VISUALIZATION***, please head to the **“visual”** folder, where you can find:

  -All the cleaned data in .rda format.

  -Code (shiny app, **app.R**) for generating the visualization.

  -Code (**plotly**) for generating the animated visualization.

*If you are looking for ****INFERENCE***, check out the **“my-website”** folder, where you can find:
 
  -Code for inference called **inf.rmd** (I also used this rmd file for my webpage).

Finally, *if you are looking for **WEBSITE-related** code*, please head to the **“my-website”**, where you can find:

  -.Rmd files for each website page. Please ignore any name with a "temp".

  -Data used for building the website.

  -.css for the website 

***
If you are *CONFUSED*, I am not surprised…The page is under construction after four years of procrastinating.
